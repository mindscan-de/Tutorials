# Tutorials

CC-BY-SA

This will become a series of single (one-shot) tutorials. I really miss writing down ideas or other stuff, which might be useful for other people.
Having a (public) repository might help to remove the clutter from my desk. Because I collect a lot of paper, papers, magazines, information and 
other stuff, which I write on paper.

Over the years I collected an awfull lot of paper, which is clogging my home, in an attempt to write books, chapters and fascicles about 
different tech-topics I find interesting, at the time. Actually I know it will not lead to a book, but maybe it can get more structure, 
if I keep it in a repository. 

None of these tutorials, chapters or fascicles will be kept up to date. They will only be updated as I learn, or as I recall some of my thoughts 
or ideas. Maybe I will review these tutorials in a few years and restructure them once in a while.

Since I am not a teacher, in the narrow sense. There is no use for me to revise these tutorials. 

All these tutorials, chapters or fascicles are considered pure fiction and only a fool would assume they are correct.
